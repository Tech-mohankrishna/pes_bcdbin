# ðŸ”± BCD to Binary Conversion ðŸ”±

A BCD-to-binary conversion converts a BCD number to the equivalent binary representation.
Assume that the input is an 8-bit signal in BCD format (i.e., two BCD digits) and the
output is a 7-bit signal in binary representation.

#### Design Stages

1) **Synthesis**
   1. **yosys** - Yosys performs RTL synthesis, converting high-level RTL descriptions into gate-level netlists.
   2. **abc** - ABC is used for further optimization and technology mapping to enhance the gate-level design.
   3. **OpenSTA** - OpenSTA conducts static timing analysis to verify if the synthesized design meets timing constraints in the OpenLane flow.

2) **Floorplan & PND**
   1. **init_fp (Initial Floorplan)** - Floorplanning involves determining the initial placement and arrangement of various functional blocks or cells within the chip's       
   layout area.
   2. **ioplacer** - ioplacer is a tool used in the physical design process to place Input/Output (I/O) pads or pins on the chip's boundary.
   3. **pdn** - The PDN is responsible for distributing power (supply voltage) and ground (reference voltage) throughout the chip, ensuring that all components receive the       necessary power supply and maintain stable electrical operation.
   4. **tapcell** - A "tapcell" is a special type of cell used in digital integrated circuit design, particularly in standard cell libraries.It is typically used to create 
   tap connections for the bulk terminals in digital CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) designs.

3) **Placement**
   1. **Replace** - RePlace is a tool used in the OpenLane flow for cell placement optimization.It focuses on optimizing the placement of standard cells within the chip's   
   layout to achieve better area utilization, timing, and power efficiency.
   2. **Resizer** - Resizer is a tool employed during the physical design process to perform cell resizing and optimization.
   3. **OpenDP (Open Detailed Placement)** - OpenDP, or Open Detailed Placement, is a detailed placement tool used in OpenLane.It is responsible for the fine-grained 
   placement of cells, ensuring that they are precisely positioned within rows and tracks while adhering to design constraints and achieving optimal utilization of the chip's 
   layout area.
   4. **OpenPhysyn (Open Physical Synthesis)** - OpenPhysyn is a tool within OpenLane that performs physical synthesis tasks.It optimizes the logical and physical aspects of 
   the design simultaneously, improving the placement, power, area, and timing by considering both logic and physical information during the optimization process.

4) **CTS**
   1. **TritonCTS** - TritonCTS generates a clock distribution network.

5) **Routing**
   1. **FastRoute** - FastRoute is a global routing tool used in the physical design stage of ASIC chip design.
   2. **TritonRoute** - TritonRoute is a detailed or global routing tool used in the later stages of ASIC chip design, following placement and initial global routing.
   
6) **GDSII Generation**
   1. **Magic** - Magic is primarily a layout tool used for creating and editing IC layouts, and it is often used for digital CMOS design.
   2. **KLayout** - KLayout is primarily used for viewing, editing, and analyzing IC layouts but is not a layout creation tool like Magic.
   
8) **Checks**
   1. **CVC** - CVC is a tool primarily used for verification and debugging of digital designs.
   2. **Netgen** - Netgen is an open-source digital netlist comparison and LVS (Layout vs. Schematic) tool.
